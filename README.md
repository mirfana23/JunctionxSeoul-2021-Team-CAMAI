# JunctionxSeoul-2021-Team-CAMAI
Our team,CAMAI, uses AI models to predict possible shift of river basins which can help human civilizations around river basins to be well-informed and make wiser decisions.
We analyze the observed patterns from satellite images and present our results!

Repo structure:
Data/ -> where raw and preprocessed images are saved
curve_peaks.ipynb -> codes for curve peaks detection
segmentation.ipynb -> codes for preprocess the raw input images
RiverLSTM.ipynb -> model for image sequence prediction
