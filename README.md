# JunctionxSeoul 2021 - Team CAMAI

Welcome to the **Team CAMAI** project repository! Our goal is to use AI models to predict shifts in river flows, assisting communities, governments, and real estate agents in making informed decisions.

## Project Goals

- Help communities around the river make better decisions
- Assist governments in developing improved infrastructure plans
- Support real estate agents in making smarter investments

We analyze observed patterns from satellite images and present our results.

## Repository Structure

- `Data/` - Directory containing raw and preprocessed satellite images
- `curve_peaks.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with code for curve peak detection
- `segmentation.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with code for preprocessing raw input images
- `RiverLSTM.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with LSTM model for image sequence prediction

## Getting Started

1. Explore the `Data/` directory to view raw and preprocessed satellite images
2. Review `curve_peaks.ipynb` for curve peak detection techniques
3. Examine `segmentation.ipynb` for preprocessing raw input images
4. Investigate `RiverLSTM.ipynb` for our LSTM-based image sequence prediction model
