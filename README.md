# JunctionxSeoul-2021-Team-CAMAI

Our team, CAMAI, uses AI models to predict possible shift in river flows. With this project, we hope to help:
* communities around the river be more well-informed and make wiser decisions
* goverments make better infrastructure plans
* real estate agents make better investments
We analyzed the observed patterns from satellite images and present our results!

Repo structure:

* Data/ -> where raw and preprocessed images are saved
* curve_peaks.ipynb -> codes for curve peaks detection
* segmentation.ipynb -> codes for preprocess the raw input images
* RiverLSTM.ipynb -> model for image sequence prediction
